## My Thoughts:
I find this article interesting and quite important because this month i have seen multiple different issues with ads being used maliciously. Some cases were featured in in-game ads, the ones that
pop up automatically, and the malicious use there was that ads were messed with to show 3-5 ads in a row instead of just 1. In case of this article, it talks about ad links that are always first
featured in google search. Although not always, but oftentimes when lookiing up information these ads are not the go to sources and redirect to weird websited. So far, the only thing that i can do 
to prevent this is to ignore the first couple recommnedations, which are ads, and scroll down to find genuine websites, which can sometimes not always be clear, and even challenging when using 
gogle search on an iPhone. Since Google is used every day at such a grand scale, it has to ensure that users are top under risk of their information being stolen or installing malicious software 
when they are using it.

## Anh's Thoughts:
As a daily Google search user, I find this very interesting too! To me, I think it is interesting because I never quite noticed the dangers of ads on Google search results. I usually avoid the ads just knowing that they paid Google to place their links on top of other "legit" results first, but sometimes, I unintentionally click the ad links when I'm unaware of the small "ad" logo. I didn't think it could be dangerous but now with the insight from this article (how these links could lead to other links of malicious software), I will definitely be more careful. Thank you for bringing awareness to this article!
